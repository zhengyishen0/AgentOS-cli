# AgentOS Ecosystem Product Specification

## Vision Statement

**Transform how humans interact with AI by creating the first true operating system for intelligent agents** - enabling seamless collaboration between people and specialized AI assistants across all devices and contexts.

## Problem Statement

Today's AI assistants are isolated, forgetful, and limited. Users must:
- Repeat context across different AI tools
- Manually coordinate between specialized assistants
- Accept that AI "forgets" previous conversations
- Switch between apps for different AI capabilities
- Trust third parties with sensitive personal data

**We believe AI should be personal, persistent, and collaborative** - working like a team of specialists who know you, remember everything, and coordinate seamlessly.

## Product Overview

### AgentCloud (Community Platform)
**The marketplace and collaboration hub** - connects AgentOS instances globally
